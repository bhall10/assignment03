            <p>
              San Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a cultural, 
              commercial, and financial center of Northern California. San Francisco is the 
              16th most populous city in the United States, and the fourth most populous in 
              California, with 881,549 residents as of 2019. It covers an area of about 46.89 
              square miles (121.4 km2), mostly at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula 
              in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it the second most densely populated large 
              U.S. city, and the fifth most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of 
              the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is part of the 12th-largest metropolitan 
              statistical area in the United States by population, with 4.7 million people, and the 
              fourth-largest by economic output, with GDP of $592 billion in 2019. With San Jose, 
              it forms the fifth most populous combined statistical area in the United States, 
              with 9.67 million residents as of 2019. Colloquial nicknames for San Francisco include 
              The City, SF, Frisco and San Fran.

              The earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the territory of the city of 
              San Francisco dates to 3000 BC. The Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few 
              small villages when an overland Spanish exploration party, led by Don Gaspar de PortolÃ¡, 
              arrived on November 2, 1769, the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay. The 
              first maritime presence occurred on August 5, 1775, when San Carlosâ€”commanded by Juan 
              Manuel de Ayalaâ€”became the first ship to anchor in the bay. The following year, on March 
              28, 1776, the Spanish established the Presidio of San Francisco, followed by a mission, 
              Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s (Mission Dolores), established by the Spanish explorer Juan 
              Bautista de Anza.

              Upon independence from Spain in 1821, the area became part of Mexico. Under Mexican rule, 
              the mission system gradually ended, and its lands became privatized. In 1835, William 
              Richardson, a naturalized Mexican citizen of English birth, erected the first independent 
              homestead,[44] near a boat anchorage around what is today Portsmouth Square. Together with 
              Alcalde Francisco de Haro, he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement, and the 
              town, named Yerba Buena, began to attract American settlers.

            <img alt="San Francisco Chinatown" src="images/sf/sf_chinatown_ca.jpg" />

            <p>
              San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States at the north end of the 
              San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San 
              Francisco Bay within its boundaries. Several picturesque islandsâ€”Alcatraz, Treasure 
              Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island, and small portions of Alameda Island, Red Rock 
              Island, and Angel Islandâ€”are part of the city. Also included are the uninhabited Farallon 
              Islands, 27 miles (43 km) offshore in the Pacific Ocean. The mainland within the city limits 
              roughly forms a "seven-by-seven-mile square", a common local colloquialism referring to the 
              city's shape, though its total area, including water, is nearly 232 square miles (600 km2).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              There are more than 50 hills within the city limits. Some neighborhoods are named after the 
              hill on which they are situated, including Nob Hill, Potrero Hill, and Russian Hill. Near 
              the geographic center of the city, southwest of the downtown area, are a series of less 
              densely populated hills. Twin Peaks, a pair of hills forming one of the city's highest points, 
              forms an overlook spot. San Francisco's tallest hill, Mount Davidson, is 928 feet (283 m) high 
              and is capped with a 103-foot (31 m) tall cross built in 1934. Dominating this area is Sutro 
              Tower, a large red and white radio and television transmission tower.

              The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market 
              Street and the waterfront. It is here that the Financial District is centered, with Union 
              Square, the principal shopping and hotel district, and the Tenderloin nearby. Cable cars 
              carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill, once the home of the city's business 
              tycoons, and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39, 
              where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a still-active fishing industry. Also in 
              this quadrant are Russian Hill, a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard 
              Street; North Beach, the city's Little Italy and the former center of the Beat Generation; 
              and Telegraph Hill, which features Coit Tower. Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San 
              Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest Chinatown in North America. The South of Market, which was 
              once San Francisco's industrial core, has seen significant redevelopment following the 
              construction of Oracle Park and an infusion of startup companies. New skyscrapers, live-work 
              lofts, and condominiums dot the area. Further development is taking place just to the south in 
              Mission Bay area, a former railroad yard, which now has a second campus of the University of 
              California, San Francisco and Chase Center, which opened in 2019 as the new home of the Golden 
              State Warriors.

              West of downtown, across Van Ness Avenue, lies the large Western Addition neighborhood, which 
              became established with a large African American population after World War II. The Western 
              Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley, the Fillmore, 
              and Japantown, which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its 
              Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II. The Western 
              Addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its Victorians largely intact, including the famous 
              "Painted Ladies", standing alongside Alamo Square. To the south, near the geographic center of 
              the city is Haight-Ashbury, famously associated with 1960s hippie culture.[citation needed] The 
              Haight is now home to some expensive boutiques[96] and a few controversial chain stores, although 
              it still retains some bohemian character.

              According to academic Rob Wilson, San Francisco is a global city, a status that pre-dated the 
              city's popularity during the California Gold Rush.[160] Such cities are characterized by their 
              ethnic clustering, network of international connectivity, and convergence of technological 
              innovation.[ Global cities, such as San Francisco, are considered to be complex and require a 
              high level of talent as well as large masses of low wage workers. A divide is created within 
              the city of ethnic, typically lower-class neighborhoods, and expensive ones with newly 
              developed buildings. This in turn creates a population of highly educated, white-collar 
              individuals as well as blue-collar workers, many of whom are immigrants, and who both are 
              drawn to the increasing number of opportunities available. Competition for these opportunities 
              pushes growth and adaptation in world centers.

              San Francisco has a diversified service economy, with employment spread across a wide range of 
              professional services, including financial services, tourism, and (increasingly) high technology. 
              In 2016, approximately 27% of workers were employed in professional business services; 14% in leisure 
              and hospitality; 13% in government services; 12% in education and health care; 11% in trade, 
              transportation, and utilities; and 8% in financial activities. In 2019, GDP in the five-county San 
              Francisco metropolitan area grew 3.8% in real terms to $592 billion. Additionally, in 2019 the 14-county 
              San Joseâ€“San Franciscoâ€“Oakland combined statistical area had a GDP of $1.086 trillion, ranking 3rd 
              among CSAs, and ahead of all but 16 countries. As of 2019, San Francisco County was the 7th 
              highest-income county in the United States (among 3,142), with a per capita personal income of $139,405. 
              Marin County, directly to the north over the Golden Gate Bridge, and San Mateo County, directly to the 
              south on the Peninsula, were the 6th and 9th highest-income counties respectively.

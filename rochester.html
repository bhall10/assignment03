            <p>
                Rochester is a city in the U.S. state of New York, the seat of Monroe County, and the 
                third-most populous in the state after New York City and Buffalo, with an estimated 
                population of 205,695 in 2020. The city of Rochester forms the core of a much larger 
                metropolitan area with a population of around 1.1 million people, across six counties.
                Rochester was one of the United States' first boomtowns, initially due to the fertile 
                Genesee River Valley, which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing 
                center, which spurred further rapid population growth. The city rose to prominence as the 
                birthplace and home of some of America's most iconic companies, in particular Eastman Kodak, 
                Xerox, and Bausch & Lomb (along with Wegmans, Gannett, Paychex, Western Union, French's, 
                Constellation Brands, Ragú, and others), by which the region became a global center for 
                science, technology, and research and development. This status has been aided by the presence 
                of several internationally renowned universities (notably the University of Rochester and Rochester 
                Institute of Technology) and their research programs; these schools, along with many other smaller 
                colleges, have played an increasingly large role in Greater Rochester's economy. Rochester has also 
                played a key part in US history as a hub for certain important social/political movements, especially 
                abolitionism and the women's rights movement. While the city experienced some significant population 
                loss as a result of deindustrialization, strong growth in the education and healthcare sectors boosted 
                by elite universities and the slower decline of bedrock companies such as Eastman Kodak and Xerox 
                (as opposed to the rapid fall of heavy industry with steel companies in Buffalo and Pittsburgh) 
                resulted in a much less severe contraction than in most Rust Belt metro areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Rochester's economy is defined by technology and education (aided by a highly educated workforce, 
                research institutions, and other strengths born in its past). The Rochester metropolitan area is the 
                third-largest regional economy in New York, after the New York City metropolitan area and the 
                Buffalo-Niagara Falls Metropolitan Area. Rochester's gross metropolitan product is US$50.6 billion—above 
                those of Albany and Syracuse, but below that of Buffalo. Rochester is also known for its culture, in 
                particular its music culture; institutions such as the Eastman School of Music (considered to be one of 
                the most prestigious conservatories in the world) and the Rochester International Jazz Festival anchor a 
                vibrant music industry, ranked as one of the top-10 music scenes in the US in terms of the concentration 
                of musicians and music-related business. It is the site of multiple major festivals every year (such as 
                the Lilac Festival, the aforementioned Jazz Festival, the Rochester Fringe Festival, and others that draw 
                hundreds of thousands of attendees each) and is home to several world-famous museums such as The Strong 
                National Museum of Play and the George Eastman Museum, the oldest photography collection in the world and 
                one of the largest. The Rochester metro is ranked highly in terms of livability and quality of life and 
                is often considered to be one of the best places in America for families due to low cost of living, 
                highly ranked public schools and a low unemployment rate. A great divide, though, exists between its 
                inner-city component (which has at times had the highest child poverty rate in the nation) and its 
                affluent, well-educated southern suburbs. It is considered to be a global city, ranked by the 
                Globalization and World Cities Research Network as having sufficiency status.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <img alt="Susan B. Anthony" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/SB_Anthony_from_RoRaWW.jpg/468px-SB_Anthony_from_RoRaWW.jpg" />

            <p>
                Rochester was founded shortly after the American Revolution by a wave of English-Puritan-descended 
                immigrants from New England, who were looking for new agricultural land. They were the dominant 
                cultural group in Rochester for over a century. On November 8, 1803, Colonel Nathaniel Rochester 
                (1752–1831), Major Charles Carroll, and Colonel William Fitzhugh, Jr. (1761–1839), all of Hagerstown, 
                Maryland, purchased a 100-acre (40-ha) tract from the state in western New York along the Genesee River. 
                They chose the site because its three cataracts on the Genesee offered great potential for water power. 
                Beginning in 1811, and with a population of 15, the three founders surveyed the land and laid out 
                streets and tracts. In 1817, the Brown brothers and other landowners joined their lands with the 
                Hundred Acre Tract to form the village of Rochesterville.
                By 1821, Rochesterville was the seat of Monroe County. In 1823, it consisted of 1,012 acres (4 km2) 
                and 2,500 residents, and the Village of Rochesterville became known as Rochester. Also in 1823, the 
                Erie Canal aqueduct over the Genesee River was completed, and the Erie Canal east to the Hudson River 
                was opened. In the early 20th century, after the advent of railroads, the presence of the canal in 
                the center city was an obstacle; it was rerouted south of Rochester by 1918 when the Barge Canal was 
                completed. By 1830, Rochester's population was 9,200, and in 1834, it was rechartered as a city.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1830–31, Rochester experienced one of the nation's biggest Protestant revivalist movements, 
                led by Charles Grandison Finney. The revival inspired other revivals of the Second Great Awakening. 
                A leading pastor in New York, who was converted in the Rochester meetings, gave this account of Finney's 
                meetings there: "The whole community was stirred. Religion was the topic of conversation in the house, 
                in the shop, in the office, and on the street. The only theater in the city was converted into a livery 
                stable; the only circus into a soap and candle factory. Grog shops were closed; the Sabbath was honored; 
                the sanctuaries were thronged with happy worshippers; a new impulse was given to every philanthropic 
                enterprise; the fountains of benevolence were opened, and men lived to good."
                By the mid-19th century, as the center of the wheat-processing industry moved west with population 
                and agriculture, the city became home to an expanding nursery business, giving rise to the city's 
                second nickname, the Flower City. Nurseries ringed the city, the most famous of which was started in 
                1840 by immigrants Georg Ellwanger from Germany and Patrick Barry from Ireland.

            <h1>Geography</h1>
            <div id="map"></div>

            <p>
                Rochester is located at 43°9′56″N 77°36′41″W (43.165496, −77.611504) in Upstate New York. The city is 
                about 73 miles (120 km) east-northeast of Buffalo and about 87 miles (140 km) west of Syracuse. Albany, 
                the state capital, is 226 miles (360 km) to the east; it sits on Lake Ontario's southern shore. The 
                Genesee River bisects the city. Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is northwest 168 miles (270 km) and New York 
                City is about 250 miles (400 km) to the southeast.
                According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 37.1 square miles (96 km2), 
                of which 35.8 square miles (93 km2) are land and 1.3 square miles (3.4 km2) are covered by water (3.42%).
                Rochester's geography was formed by the ice sheets during the Pleistocene epoch. The retreating ice sheets 
                reached a standstill at what is now the southern border of the city, melting at the same rate as they were advancing, 
                depositing sediment along the southern edge of the ice mass. This created a line of hills, including (from west to east) 
                Mt. Hope, the hills of Highland Park, Pinnacle Hill, and Cobb's Hill. Because the sediment of these hills was deposited 
                into a proglacial lake, they are stratified and classified as a "kame delta". A brief retreat and readvance of the ice 
                sheet onto the delta deposited unstratified material there, creating a rare hybrid structure called "kame moraine".
            </p>
            <p>
                The ice sheets also created Lake Ontario (one of the five freshwater Great Lakes), the Genesee River with 
                its waterfalls and gorges, Irondequoit Bay, Sodus Bay, Braddock Bay, Mendon Ponds, numerous local streams 
                and ponds, the Ridge, and the nearby Finger Lakes.
                Rochester has 537 miles (864 km) of public streets, 585 miles (941 km) of water mains, 44 vehicular and eight 
                pedestrian bridges, 11 public libraries, two police stations (one for the east side, one for the west), and 
                15 firehouses. The principal source of water is Hemlock Lake, which, with its watershed, is owned by the state 
                of New York. Other water sources include Canadice Lake and Lake Ontario. The 30-year annual average snowfall is 
                just above 100 in (2.5 m). The monthly daily average ranges from 24.7 °F (−4.1 °C) in January to 70.8 °F (21.6 °C) in July. 
                The high amount of snow Rochester receives can be accounted for by the city's proximity to Lake Ontario (see lake-effect snow).

            <h1>Education</h1>
            <img alt="Rush Rhees, the library of the University of Rochester" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Rush_Rhees_Library_%288695462255%29.jpg/1024px-Rush_Rhees_Library_%288695462255%29.jpg" />

            <p>
                The City of Rochester is served by the Rochester City School District, which encompasses all public primary and secondary education. 
                The district is governed by a popularly elected seven-member board of education. Also, parochial and private primary and secondary 
                schools are located within the city. Rochester City Schools consistently post below-average results when compared to the rest of New York, 
                although on-time graduation rates have improved significantly during the past three years. However, the high-school graduation rate for African-American 
                males is lower in Rochester than in any city in the United States (9%). Charter schools in the city include Rochester Academy Charter School.
                Rochester and the surrounding region host a high concentration of colleges and universities, which drive much of the economic growth in the five-county 
                area. The University of Rochester is the only large research institution primarily within the city limits, although Monroe Community College and SUNY 
                Brockport operate campuses downtown. The Highland Park neighborhood is home to Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School (part of whose facility is leased 
                by Ithaca College's Department of Physical Therapy) and an office maintained by the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The University of Rochester is the metropolitan area's oldest and most prominent institution of higher learning, and one of the country's top research centers. 
                It was ranked as the 29th-best university in the nation by U.S. News & World Report for 2019 and was deemed "one of the new Ivies" by Newsweek. The nursing school 
                has received many awards and honors and the Simon School of Business is also ranked in the top 30 in many categories.
                The university is also home to the Eastman School of Music, which was ranked the number-one music school in America. It was founded and endowed by George Eastman 
                in his years as a philanthropist. He also contributed greatly to the University of Rochester from wealth based on the success of Eastman Kodak.
            </p>
                
                <h2>Former colleges</h2>
                <p>Four institutions began operations in the city and later moved to Rochester's inner-ring suburbs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Empire State College Rochester Learning Center moved from its Prince Street address to Irondequoit in 1999.</li>
                    <li>Monroe Community College moved from Alexander Street to Brighton in 1968.</li>
                    <li>Rochester Institute of Technology moved from South Washington Street to Henrietta, also in 1968.</li>
                    <li>St. Bernard's School of Theology and Ministry moved from space leased in Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School to Pittsford in 2003.</li>
                </ul>

                    New York City consists of five boroughs, which are five separate counties. 
                    Each borough has a unique culture and could be a large city in its own right. 
                    Within each borough individual neighborhoods, some several square miles in size, 
                    and others only a few blocks in size, have personalities lauded in music and 
                    film.

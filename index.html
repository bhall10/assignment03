                Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and
                fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It
                is the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8
                million as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the
                Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the
                Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza is most famous as the location of the 
                Giza Plateau, the site of the some of the most imporessive and ancient 
                monuments in the world.

                Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo which served as the
                necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Most
                famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560 BCE) and the
                Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE),recent excavations on the plateau
                have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers'
                quarters. The original necropolis of Giza was laid out with
                amazing precision and skill but, once it became associated with
                the great kings of Egypt and their pyramids, attracted the
                attention of less prominent officals of lower rank. These
                officials had enough money and prestige to buy their way into
                burial plots at Giza but had no regard for the symmetry of the
                original schematics and had their tombs dug wherever they found
                available space. This resulted ina number of grave complexes
                throughout Giza which would not have been authorized by the kings
                who built the famous pyramids which, thorughout history, have
                drawn vistors from around the world.

                New York City consists of five boroughs, which are five separate counties. 
                Each borough has a unique culture and could be a large city in its own right. 
                Within each borough individual neighborhoods, some several square miles in size, 
                and others only a few blocks in size, have personalities lauded in music and 
                film. Where you live, work, and play in New York says something to New Yorkers 
                about who you are. The five New York boroughs are: New York City District Map.png 
                Manhattan (New York County) The famous island between the Hudson and East Rivers, 
                with many diverse and unique neighborhoods. Manhattan is home to the Empire State 
                Building in Midtown, Central Park, Times Square, Wall Street, Harlem, and the trendy 
                neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and SoHo. Brooklyn (Kings County) The most populous 
                borough, and formerly a separate city. Located south and east of Manhattan across the 
                East River.
            </p>
            <br>

                Known for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Prospect Park, The Brooklyn Museum, The New 
                York Aquarium and a key NYC landmark Coney Island. Queens (Queens County) Located to 
                the east of Manhattan, across the East River, and north, east, and south of Brooklyn. 
                With over 170 languages spoken, Queens is the most ethnically diverse region in the 
                United States, and one of the most diverse in the world. The Bronx (Bronx County) 
                Located north of Manhattan Island, the Bronx is home to the Bronx Zoo, the New York 
                Botanical Gardens, and the New York Yankees professional baseball team. Staten Island 
                (Richmond County) A large island in New York Harbor, south of Manhattan and just across 
                the narrow Kill Van Kull from New Jersey. Unlike the rest of New York City, Staten Island 
                has a suburban character. It is known as the borough of parks. It has its own baseball 
                team, several malls, and a zoo.

            <h1>Rochester</h1>
            <img alt="Downtown Rochester Skyline" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Downtown_Rochester%2C_NY_HDR_by_patrickashley.jpg" />

            <p>
                Rochester is a city in the U.S. state of New York, the seat of Monroe County, and the 
                third-most populous in the state after New York City and Buffalo, with an estimated 
                population of 205,695 in 2020. The city of Rochester forms the core of a much larger 
                metropolitan area with a population of around 1.1 million people, across six counties.
                Rochester was one of the United States' first boomtowns, initially due to the fertile 
                Genesee River Valley, which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing 
                center, which spurred further rapid population growth. The city rose to prominence as the 
                birthplace and home of some of America's most iconic companies, in particular Eastman Kodak, 
                Xerox, and Bausch & Lomb (along with Wegmans, Gannett, Paychex, Western Union, French's, 
                Constellation Brands, Ragú, and others), by which the region became a global center for 
                science, technology, and research and development. This status has been aided by the presence 
                of several internationally renowned universities (notably the University of Rochester and Rochester 
                Institute of Technology) and their research programs; these schools, along with many other smaller 
                colleges, have played an increasingly large role in Greater Rochester's economy. Rochester has also 
                played a key part in US history as a hub for certain important social/political movements, especially 
                abolitionism and the women's rights movement. While the city experienced some significant population 
                loss as a result of deindustrialization, strong growth in the education and healthcare sectors boosted 
                by elite universities and the slower decline of bedrock companies such as Eastman Kodak and Xerox 
                (as opposed to the rapid fall of heavy industry with steel companies in Buffalo and Pittsburgh) 
                resulted in a much less severe contraction than in most Rust Belt metro areas.

                Today, Rochester's economy is defined by technology and education (aided by a highly educated workforce, 
                research institutions, and other strengths born in its past). The Rochester metropolitan area is the 
                third-largest regional economy in New York, after the New York City metropolitan area and the 
                Buffalo-Niagara Falls Metropolitan Area. Rochester's gross metropolitan product is US$50.6 billion—above 
                those of Albany and Syracuse, but below that of Buffalo. Rochester is also known for its culture, in 
                particular its music culture; institutions such as the Eastman School of Music (considered to be one of 
                the most prestigious conservatories in the world) and the Rochester International Jazz Festival anchor a 
                vibrant music industry, ranked as one of the top-10 music scenes in the US in terms of the concentration 
                of musicians and music-related business. It is the site of multiple major festivals every year (such as 
                the Lilac Festival, the aforementioned Jazz Festival, the Rochester Fringe Festival, and others that draw 
                hundreds of thousands of attendees each) and is home to several world-famous museums such as The Strong 
                National Museum of Play and the George Eastman Museum, the oldest photography collection in the world and 
                one of the largest. The Rochester metro is ranked highly in terms of livability and quality of life and 
                is often considered to be one of the best places in America for families due to low cost of living, 
                highly ranked public schools and a low unemployment rate. A great divide, though, exists between its 
                inner-city component (which has at times had the highest child poverty rate in the nation) and its 
                affluent, well-educated southern suburbs. It is considered to be a global city, ranked by the 
                Globalization and World Cities Research Network as having sufficiency status.

            <h1>San Francisco</h1>
            <img alt="San Francisco Skyscraper" src="images/sf/sf_skyscraper.jpg" />

            <p>
              San Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a cultural, 
              commercial, and financial center of Northern California. San Francisco is the 
              16th most populous city in the United States, and the fourth most populous in 
              California, with 881,549 residents as of 2019. It covers an area of about 46.89 
              square miles (121.4 km2), mostly at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula 
              in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it the second most densely populated large 
              U.S. city, and the fifth most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of 
              the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is part of the 12th-largest metropolitan 
              statistical area in the United States by population, with 4.7 million people, and the 
              fourth-largest by economic output, with GDP of $592 billion in 2019. With San Jose, 
              it forms the fifth most populous combined statistical area in the United States, 
              with 9.67 million residents as of 2019. Colloquial nicknames for San Francisco include 
              The City, SF, Frisco and San Fran.

              The earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the territory of the city of 
              San Francisco dates to 3000 BC. The Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few 
              small villages when an overland Spanish exploration party, led by Don Gaspar de PortolÃ¡, 
              arrived on November 2, 1769, the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay. The 
              first maritime presence occurred on August 5, 1775, when San Carlosâ€”commanded by Juan 
              Manuel de Ayalaâ€”became the first ship to anchor in the bay. The following year, on March 
              28, 1776, the Spanish established the Presidio of San Francisco, followed by a mission, 
              Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s (Mission Dolores), established by the Spanish explorer Juan 
              Bautista de Anza.

              Upon independence from Spain in 1821, the area became part of Mexico. Under Mexican rule, 
              the mission system gradually ended, and its lands became privatized. In 1835, William 
              Richardson, a naturalized Mexican citizen of English birth, erected the first independent 
              homestead,[44] near a boat anchorage around what is today Portsmouth Square. Together with 
              Alcalde Francisco de Haro, he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement, and the 
              town, named Yerba Buena, began to attract American settlers.

            <h1>Giza</h1>
            <img alt="Giza" src="images/giza/city.jpg" />

            <p>
                Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and
                fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It
                is the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8
                million as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the
                Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the
                Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza is most famous as the location of the 
                Giza Plateau, the site of the some of the most imporessive and ancient 
                monuments in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo which served as the
                necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Most
                famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560 BCE) and the
                Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE),recent excavations on the plateau
                have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers'
                quarters. The original necropolis of Giza was laid out with
                amazing precision and skill but, once it became associated with
                the great kings of Egypt and their pyramids, attracted the
                attention of less prominent officals of lower rank. These
                officials had enough money and prestige to buy their way into
                burial plots at Giza but had no regard for the symmetry of the
                original schematics and had their tombs dug wherever they found
                available space. This resulted ina number of grave complexes
                throughout Giza which would not have been authorized by the kings
                who built the famous pyramids which, thorughout history, have
                drawn vistors from around the world.

            <p>
                Although the Giza plateau is most closely associated with the pyramids
                of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the site was used as early as the
                First Dynasty of Egypt as evidenced by the tomb of the king Djet which
                was found toward the edge of the plateau. Evidence of at least one
                king from the Second Dynasty (Nynetjer) buried at Giza has also been
                found. Further, inscriptions relate how king Khufu had to clear many
                earlier tombs and grave complexes to build the Great Pyramid. What
                happened to the corpses or the grave goods from those tombs is not
                known.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Great Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the pyramid of Cheops, the
                king's Greek name) is the last remaining of the ancient Seven Wonders
                of the World and rises to a height of 481 feet (147 metres). The
                pyramid of Khafre is 471 feet tall(144 metres) and that of Menkaure
                rises to 213 feet (65 metres). The Great Sphinx sits on the eastern
                side of the plateau apart from the pyramids but it is thought it once
                was an important part of the pyramid complex which covered the area.
                The head of the Sphinx is believed by Egyptologists to be that of the
                king Khafre though others contend that represents Khufu. Further on,
                the great solar barge of Khufu, which is the oldest intact ship
                extant, was found buried in a pit near the Great Pyramid in 1954 CE.
                Dating from c.2500 BCE, the ship is 143 feet (43 metres) long and 19
                feet (5.9 metres) wide. Near the Pyramid complex there are a number of
                smaller structures known as the Queens Pyramids. It is uncertain who
                was buried beneath these pyramids but evidence suggests they were the
                tombs of Hetepheres I (Khufu's mother), Meretites (Khufu's wife) and a
                later queen named Henutsen.

            <h1>Tombs</h1>

            <p>
                The original layout of the necropolis at Giza seems to have been very
                precise and well-ordered but, after the end of the Old Kingdom, other
                tombs were dug without regard for the original pattern. Sometimes they
                were dug above existing tombs, making present-day Giza a wealth of
                archaeological material. Recent excavations have uncovered tombs of
                high officials, magistrates, and supervisors of building projects, as
                well as monuments honoring the Egyptian workers who labored on the
                pyramids and others who were employed and lived in the immediate
                vicinity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Largely due to engravings and etchings from the 19th century and early
                20th centuries CE (and postcards and calendars of modern times) many
                people think of the Giza plateau and the pyramids as resting in a
                remote, wind-swept desert locale, when in reality it sits at the very
                edge of urban sprawl of Cairo today. In its time it would have also
                been a center of daily activity with many buildings, colonnades,
                terraces and shops. The image of the Giza plateau in the modern day is
                thus vastly different from how it looked during the Fourth Dynasty of
                Egypt when the pyramids were built. There was a worker's village,
                which has been discovered and excavated, around 1300 feet (400 meters)
                south of the Great Sphinx where the laborers who worked on Menkaure's
                pyramid lived and those who built Khufu's pyramid founded a small
                village (Khufu's Village) on the far side of the complex.

            <h1>Abandonment and Discovery</h1>
            <img alt="Giza pyramids and Sphinx" src="images/giza/giza2.jpg" />

            <p>
                During the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181-2040 BCE) Giza was
                abandoned and fell into decay during the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040-1782
                BCE). The tombs, including the pyramids, were broken into and robbed
                and kings of the Middle Kingdom tore down temples, broke up walkways,
                and removed statuary for use in their own building projects. The
                pharaohs of the New Kingdom (1570-1069 BCE) reversed this policy and
                dedicated themselves to preservation efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rameses II (1279-1213 BCE) was especially interested in Giza and had a
                small temple built there in front of the Sphinx. It was Rameses fourth
                son Khaemweset, however, who worked the hardest to preserve the site.
                Khaemweset never ruled Egypt but was a crown prince whose efforts to
                restore the monuments of the past are well documented. In fact, he is
                considered today the world's "first Egyptologist" for his work in
                restoration, preservation, and recording of ancient monuments.
                Khaemweset brought the Giza plateau back to life and it continued to
                be used as a necropolis by the following dynasties, with less and less
                frequency, until Egypt was taken over by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE.
